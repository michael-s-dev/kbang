/// The \c QSimpleUpdater class manages the updater system and allows for
/// parallel application modules to check for updates and download them.
///
/// The behavior of each updater can be regulated by specifying the update
/// definitions URL (from where we download the individual update definitions)
/// and defining the desired options by calling the individual "setter"
/// functions (e.g. \c setNotifyOnUpdate()).
///
/// The \c QSimpleUpdater also implements an integrated downloader.
/// If you need to use a custom install procedure/code, just create a function
/// that is called when the \c downloadFinished() signal is emitted to
/// implement your own install procedures.
///
/// By default, the downloader will try to open the file as if you opened it
/// from a file manager or a web browser (with the "file:///" url).
